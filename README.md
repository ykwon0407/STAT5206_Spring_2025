## Learning outcomes
This course is designed for beginners who do NOT have any experience in Python programming. We will cover following topics:
- Basic concepts for Python programming
  - Data types, Functions, Control flow (loop/if-else)
- Data acquisition
  - Data collection using API and SQL query
- Data wrangling for statistical analysis
  - from hierarchical structured data to tabular data
- Data visualization
  - scatterplot, histogram, boxplot, ...
- Basic statistical analysis
  - linear model, simple optimization

## Prerequisites
- An introductory statistics class
  - Basic probability distributions (e.g. Gaussian, binomial distributions and their likelihoods)
  - Basic hypothesis testing (e.g. t-test)
  - Summary statistics
  - Histograms, boxplots, etc
- Multivariate calculus
  - Derivatives and functions
- Matrix operations and inverses of matrices
- You should be at least co-enrolled in a modeling class like regression

##### Exam accommodations
In order to receive disability-related academic accommodations for this course, students must first be registered with their school Disability Services (DS) office. Detailed information is available online for both the [Columbia](https://health.columbia.edu/content/disability-services) and Barnard registration processes.

Refer to the appropriate website for information regarding deadlines, disability documentation requirements, and [drop-in hours](https://health.columbia.edu/getting-care/drop-offices/disability-services-drop-hours) (Columbia)/intake session (Barnard).


For this course, students are not required to have testing forms or accommodation letters signed by faculty. However, students must do the following:

·         The Instructor section of the form has already been completed and does not need to be signed by the professor.

·         The student must complete the Student section of the form and submit the form to Disability Services.

·         Master forms are available in the Disability Services office or online: https://health.columbia.edu/services/testing-accommodations


## Expectations
- Take chances!
  - Break the code in lecture
- Give feedback in office hours or e-mail, don't waste your time if you think a topic is not helpful
- Participate and ask questions, this is not easy!
  - In class: forecast what should be done, compare with what is happening, then summarize the difference.
  - Online: describe what you observe, describe what you expect, communicate clearly.
  - To each other: summarize the conversation to ensure you're listening and think constructively before criticizing.
- **THE MOST IMPORTANT** Academic honesty: https://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/honesty/
